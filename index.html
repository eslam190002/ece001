<h2>A brief introduction to programming</h2>
<div></div><p>Programming can be defined as the process of writing instructions 
	and commands for a computer or any other device, to guide it and 
	inform it how to handle the data or how to perform a series of required works.
The programming process follows rules specific to the language
 chosen by the programmer.
Each language has its own characteristics that distinguish it from
 the other and make it suitable to varying degrees for each 
 type of program and the task required of this program.
Programming languages also have common characteristics 
	and common boundaries, since all of them are designed to deal with computers.
