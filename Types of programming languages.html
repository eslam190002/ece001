<h2>Types of programming languages by level</h2>

<p>Programming languages can be divided into two types depending on their level of proximity to machine language, which the computer understands directly and is represented by numbers. The first type of programming languages by this classification are low-level programming languages, which are the closest programming languages to the machine language, so that the machine language is the lowest level, and comes at a lower level than assembly language, as these languages are characterized by the fact that they include only commands understood by the computer, and therefore the most It is far from the language that man understands, but at the same time allows the programmer to have full control over his program.
</p>
<p>The other type of programming by-level language is high-level languages, which are far the most distant from the machine language and closest to human understanding, but also do not provide the same amount of control as low-level languages for the programmer, in terms of the way the computer organizes memory and data. An important feature of high-level programming languages is to enable the programmer to use variables, objects, as well as Routines, and Loops, sometimes with high-level programming languages, a large amount of commands can be executed by typing only one line. Examples of such programming languages are Python and Ruby.
